# DevExtreme with Webpack and jQuery

This starter project has been created by [generator-devextreme](https://github.com/oliversturm/generator-devextreme) and includes [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [DevExtreme](https://js.devexpress.com/) widgets. 

Based on options used when the generator was run, localization support has been included on the basis of [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) and the [DevExtreme-Intl](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-Intl) library. No language files apart from those for the standard 'en' locale have been added.
